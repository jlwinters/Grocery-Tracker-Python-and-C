## Project Summary
The goal of this project was to create an item-tracking program for a hypothetical grocery store that links both C++ and Python. The program is designed to display a UI that prompts for user input and executes several functions. Using an item list file, the first option produces a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the frequency. The second option allows the user to input a specific grocery item, and the program will return the frequency of that specific item. The third option displays a histogram of the item data file, with asterisks representing the frequency of each item. Lastly, the user also has the option to close the program.
